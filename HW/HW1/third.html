            <p class ="cryptography"><FONT size="4">Integer factorization, which underpins the security of public key cryptographic systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few prime numbers (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<br/>
                                                    By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using Shor's algorithm to find its factors.
                                                    This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem.

            <p class ="cryptography"><FONT size="4">Besides factorization and discrete logarithms, quantum algorithms offering a more than polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm have been found for several problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid state physics, the approximation of Jones polynomials, and solving Pell's equation.<br/> <br/><br/>
                                                    No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely.
                                                    For some problems, quantum computers offer a polynomial speedup.<br />
                                                    The most well-known example of this is quantum database search, which can be solved by Grover's algorithm using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups.
